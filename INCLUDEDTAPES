In media/ folder you can find some tapes, snapshots, cartridges and EPROM cards for the emulated machines.
I included them for different reasons:

- They are important programs or games for a machine, like Mazogs on ZX81

- They make some hi-res and special effects, like Overscan on Spectrum or Manic miner on ZX81

- They are programs and games made by myself, found on tapes/spectrum/myself folder. Most of them are simple programs written in basic, that I made when I was a child, and some other are more complexe programs, like the SPED compiler, RealDebug debugger, or Cursor Draw drawing program. Some of these programs have documentation found on zesarux.odt file. Note: some of these simple games, made in basic, have kempston joystick support. Well they were programmed on Inves Spectrum + and kempston joystick reading only works on Inves and not on other Spectrum machines.
