ZEsarUX is free software and you don't need to pay to use it. 
ZEsarUX will always cost you nothing to use, but that doesn't mean it costs me nothing to make.
So if you want to demonstrate your appreciation to it, you can donate using Paypal. Just visit the section "Donations" on the project web site:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/zesarux/

Thanks!
