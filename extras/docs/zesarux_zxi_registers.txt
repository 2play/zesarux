ZEsarUX ZXI Port register: 53051 (CF3BH)
ZEsarUX ZXI Port data:     57147 (DF3BH)

To write a register, first OUT to port register 0xCF3B and then OUT to port data 0xDF3B
To read a register, first OUT to port register 0xCF3B and then IN from port data 0xDF3B
You can also read the register selection doing a IN from port 0xCF3B
Port register 0xCF3B is set to zero when doing a reset

You must enable these ports from menu->settings->debug->hardware debug ports (or command line --hardware-debug-ports)



There are 256 possible registers:

----

* Reg 0: CONTROL_BITS0. Set to 0 when doing a reset

Bit 0: Set to 1 to map lower 16kb inves memory ram readable from 0000-3fffh
Bits 1-7: Unused


----

* Reg 1: HARDWARE_DEBUG_ASCII

Write this register to output an ascii character to the pc console. Must be enabled on debug settings


----

* Reg 2: HARDWARE_DEBUG_NUMBER 

Write this register to output a number to the pc console. Must be enabled on debug settings


----

* Reg 3: ZEsarUX control register
Bit 0: Set to 1 to exit emulator
Bit 1-7: Unused


----

* Reg 4: ZEsarUX version number

Used to get ZEsarUX version number string. 
Emulator version format:
XX.YY-S

XX: Major version number. 1 or 2 digits number. Currently using only one digit but could be greater (on ZEsarUX version 10 or higher)
YY: Minor version number. 1 or 2 digits number
-S: Optional string, only present on non-stable versions. S it's normally "SN" or "RC", where RC can also be RCX, being X a digit: RC1, RC2, etc

Examples

6.0: Means major version 6, minor version 0. It's a stable version (no suffix string -....)

6.1-RC: Means major version 6, minor version 1, beta version: RC



You must write first to this register (with value 0) to reset index string to position 0 (you could even write any value to change the index)
Then read this register to get the string, every read will get a character (the index is incremented every read), finishing the string with character 0. When it reaches the end, the index string is reset to the beginning.
Index is reset to 0 every reset


----

* Reg 5: ZEsarUX build number

Used to get ZEsarUX build number string. Build number is the unix time of the ZEsarUX compilation
Same behaviour as "Reg 4: ZEsarUX version number": write value 0 here to reset string index. 
Every read will get a character, finishing the string with character 0. When it reaches the end, the index string is reset to the beginning.
Index is reset to 0 every reset

----

* Reg 6-255: Unused
