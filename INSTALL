This file tells how to install ZEsarUX on Unix systems: Linux, Mac OS X, Raspberry.
Windows related information is on file INSTALLWINDOWS

* Requirements

gcc compiler
unix compatible operating system

The minimum features I recommend:

On Linux:

* x11
* libssl
* libpthreads
* alsa 
* pulse 

On Mac OS X:

* gcc, which can be installed with XCode. libssl and libpthreads are also included with XCode
* video support is provided by Cocoa driver, but you can also try to compile using X11 or another video driver

On Raspberry:
* libssl
* libpthreads
* alsa
* video support is provided by Framebuffer driver (fbdev), but you can also try to compile using X11, SDL or another video driver
* sdl 1.2 is recommended, to use sdl audio. SDL audio works better than alsa. You can install sdl libraries with: apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

I recommend minimum Raspberry Pi 2. Raspberri Pi 1 is a bit slow for ZEsarUX, but you can run at normal Spectrum speed by setting overclock on the Pi and 
having Real Video setting disabled


The rest is optional. Complete list of features:

-Video drivers
* x11 (on Linux/Raspberry): needs x11libs, x11extlibs, xf86vidmode, xxf86vm
* x11 (on Mac OS X): needs XQuartz
* cocoa (on Mac OS X): Compiling supported using XCode.
* sdl 1.2 (on Linux/Raspberry): needs sdllib-1.2
* caca: cacalib
* aa: aalib
* curses: curses-dev
* stdout: termios includes

-Audio drivers
* OSS (dsp) (on Linux/Raspberry): needs soundcard includes. Usually included on Linux systems
* alsa (on Linux/Raspberry): needs alsalibs
* pulse (on Linux/Raspberry): needs pulselibs
* sdl (on Linux/Raspberry): needs sdllib
* coreaudio (on Mac OS X): Compiling supported using XCode. 

-Audio output to file
* libsndfile to output audio to wav files
* raw audio is always supported


-Other enhancements:

*pthreads: pthread includes. Usually included on all Unix systems
*realtime: sched includes. Usually included on Linux systems
*autodetect snapshots and tape files: libssl


-------------


* Compiling

./configure 


(You may also enable the features:
./configure --enable-memptr --enable-visualmem --enable-cpustats
It makes the emulator use a bit more CPU power)


(On raspberry-raspbian, I recommend:
export CFLAGS=-O2
export LDFLAGS=-O2

./configure --enable-raspberry
and not enable memptr, visualmem or cpustats
)


(On Mac OS X, I recommend:
export CFLAGS=-O3
export LDFLAGS=-O3
./configure ... with the options you want
)


make clean
make

You may try to run from the current dir, without installing, with:
./zesarux

On raspberry the recommended way is:
./zesarux --disableborder --zoom 1 --fullscreen --vo fbdev --ao sdl


---------------


* Installing ZEsarUX:

- On MacOS systems, run:
make macapp
You will get the ZEsarUX app on the folder macos/. You may want to move to the "Applications" folder on your Mac
You will also get the ZEsarUX compressed image app on the folder macos/


- On Linux and other Unix systems:

-If installing from source code:
make
su root
make install

-If installing from binary:
su root
./install.sh


---------------


* Utilities
You can compile them with
make utilities
